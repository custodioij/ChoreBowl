# ChoreBowl
This is app is a little personal project to organize tasks and pick them out randomly for you to do. The idea, which is not mine, is that you must do whatever it picked, regardless of your preferences at the moment.

## Usage
1. Write down a task in the box on top and press Done. The task will show up on the list below. Input as many tasks as you need.
2. Tap the bowl. It will pick a random task and display in a popup. You then have two options:
   1. Accept the task. Then it stays on the screen.
   2. Put it back. It goes back to the list, and you can tap the bowl again to pick a task.
3. Once you complete a task, press "I did it" and it gets removed from the list.
